
This repository is made to show my skills and abilities acquired through education and training. It combines **theory and practice**, containig tools and projects that are both educational and practical. Each folder explores a different domain, with well-structured projects, clean implementations, and thoughtful use cases.

## Repository Structure

### Calculus
Mathematical computation projects focused on series expansion and expression evaluation.

- **`series_calculator.py`**  
  Implements a calculator for mathematical series, allowing exploration of convergence and numerical approximation.  
- **`calc_expression_by_x.py`**  
  Evaluates calculus-based expressions dynamically for given values of *x*, bridging symbolic computation and practical evaluation.

### Data Analysis
Real datasets analyzed and visualized with **Python (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)**, highlighting insights through data storytelling.

- **Weather Analysis**  
  Explores meteorological data, detecting trends and seasonal patterns with visualizations.  
- **Financial Analysis**  
  Applies data analysis to financial datasets, generating performance insights, comparisons, and time-series evaluations.
  

### Morphological Operations
Implementation of **morphological image processing techniques** — essential in computer vision.  

- Includes operations like:
  - **Erosion**
  - **Dilation**
  - **Opening**
  - **Closing** 
- Supports experimenting with **different structuring elements**, providing flexibility for image transformations and analysis.

### Structures
Core computer science data structure explorations.

- **`graphs.ipynb`**
  Interactive notebook with multiple graph algorithms:  
  - Representations (adjacency list & matrix)  
  - Traversals (DFS, BFS)  
  - Pathfinding (Dijkstra’s, connected components)  
  - Applications in networks, dependencies, and cycle detection  
- **`matrix_traversal.py`**
  Demonstrates efficient traversal patterns in 2D matrices — a fundamental building block for algorithms involving grids, dynamic programming, and search problems.
