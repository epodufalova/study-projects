# Calculus Utilities

This repository contains two Python programs made for mathematical computation. They demonstrate robust handling of mathematical expressions, domain validation, and iterative series calculation with precision control.

## Projects

### 1. Expression Calculator (`calc_expression_by_x.py`)
A program that calculates the value of a complex mathematical expression for a given real number `x`, with thorough domain checking and error handling.

### 2. Series Sum Calculator (`series_calculator.py`)
A program that computes the sum of an infinite series at a given point `x` within the domain `[0, 1]` until the terms become smaller than a specified precision `epsilon`.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3
