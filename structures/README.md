# Matrix Traversal

This program demonstrates a custom traversal of a square matrix.  
It generates a random matrix (with values between 0.25 and 0.75) and traverses its **right quarter-triangle**, starting from the center and moving in a zig-zag pattern perpendicular to the main diagonal.

## Features
- User-defined matrix dimension `n × n`
- Random matrix generation with values in `[0.25, 0.75]`
- Traversal of the right triangular part of the matrix
- Robust error handling for invalid input, memory errors, or interruptions


## Graphs (`graphs.ipynb`)

This notebook introduces **graph data structures** and their applications.  
It covers essential concepts and algorithms for working with graphs, including:

- **Graph Representations**
  - Adjacency lists
  - Adjacency matrices
- **Graph Traversals**
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Pathfinding & Connectivity**
  - Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra’s)
  - Connected components
- **Use Cases**
  - Networks (social, computer, transport)
  - Dependency resolution
  - Cycle detection
