# Morphological Operations in Image Processing

A Python implementation of fundamental morphological operations for image processing, including dilation, erosion, opening, and closing with various structuring elements.

## Overview

This project provides a complete implementation of basic morphological operations used in image processing and computer vision. Morphological operations are particularly useful for processing binary images, extracting features, and removing noise.

## Features

- **Dilation**: Expands bright regions in an image
- **Erosion**: Shrinks bright regions in an image  
- **Opening**: Erosion followed by dilation (removes small objects)
- **Closing**: Dilation followed by erosion (fills small holes)
- **Multiple Structuring Elements**:
  - Rectangle
  - Cross
  - Circle
